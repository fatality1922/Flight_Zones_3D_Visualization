This project is purposed to visualise flight zones of Poland in 3D. </br>
That means both vertical and horizontal borders are showed correctly.</br>
Dependend on mapbox style of the map you can also see terrain elevation 
and buildings. 

Shown zones has maximum height based on fakeHeight parameter created to prevent 3D display bugs </br>
in cases when zones have equal heights. 
This implies some inaccuracy, nevertheless it has minimal impact </br> 
on the proper presentation of the zones.
